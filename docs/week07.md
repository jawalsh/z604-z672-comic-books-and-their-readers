# Week 7: Text analysis lab

## Summary
Today we will spend the class period using and experimenting with text analysis tools we learned about before the break.

Explore a text corpus using the text analysis tools we have learned about in class (Voyant, AntConc, Mallet), or other tools you may have found on your own. You may use your own text corpus that you may be assembling for your final project, the _Amazing Spider-Man_ fanmail (“The Spider’s Web”) corpus, or another set of texts available on the Web. You may work alone or in small groups of two or three. 

Another possible activity is to view your Mallet topic model results in Excel or another spreadsheet program and experiment with creating charts or visualizations of the data. If you are having difficulty installing or running Mallet on your computer, you may use these pre-generated topic models.
